Title: Case #981492 - FooPharmaceutical Encountered Issue with Python 3.8 Jupyter Sessions (Solved)

Description: FooPharmaceutical encountered an issue where they were unable to launch Jupyter sessions using Python 3.8. The error message was "error: Engine exited with status 129." This problem started on Friday for the specific project "biomarker-data." They could start sessions in new projects, but the issue occurred with some existing projects using Python 3.8.

Timeline:

Pete Lion from FooPharmaceutical requested an immediate call to address the issue as it was impacting many user workloads.
Pete Lion informed that they were able to launch Jupyter sessions with Python 3.7, but faced timeouts with Python 3.8.
Audrey Hawk from the Critical Incident Management team acknowledged the escalation request.
Emma Giraffe from Cloudera Support joined the case and suggested a Screen Share Session.
During the session, Emma Giraffe determined that the issue occurred only with the "biomarker-data" project and Python 3.8 in specific runtime images.
Emma Giraffe requested additional information about the project's packages, recent installations, and configuration changes.
After a Zoom meeting, Pete Lion confirmed that the issue was resolved.
The root cause was identified as users manually installing custom versions of Jupyter Lab and ipython. The long-term fix involves removing the user-installed packages or creating a new project without interfering packages.
The case was closed and marked as solved.
Conclusion: Case #981492 has been resolved. The issue involving the inability to launch Jupyter sessions with Python 3.8 has been addressed by identifying and omitting the user-installed packages interfering with pre-installed packages or creating a new project without such packages.
