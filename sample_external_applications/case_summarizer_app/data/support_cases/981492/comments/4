Thanks for contactingg Cloudera Support. My name is Emma and I will be assisting you on the CML case.

I understand that in the CML workspace, you are not able to launch a python 3.8 Jupyter session, emitting error message "Engine exited with status 129". However, you are able to launch different python sessions.

Are you able to join a Zoom session so that we can quickly go through the issue?

Emma is inviting you to a scheduled Zoom meeting.
